# Kanban Board Project!

This project is an open-ended app that allows users to create and manage "boards" and "board items". The purpose and function of the app is up to the user to decide, but some examples of similar apps include to-do lists, brainstorm boards, kanban boards, and shopping list apps.

---

The project uses React and TailwindCSS for styling. It also utilizes react-router for navigation between pages and Firebase for data storage.

- Users can create boards and board items, which should include:

  - a due date
  - a title,
  - a boolean flag for completed or not completed
  - an assignee

- Users can also edit and save any properties of a task
- Delete boards and board items
- Toggle between "list" and "board" views of all the boards.
- Completed tasks are not shown on the main boards
- Completed tasks can be viewed in a separate page/route.

The project includes a navbar with links to the "home page" (board overview), "about", and "completed".

We hope you enjoy using the Board Project to organize and manage your tasks and ideas!
